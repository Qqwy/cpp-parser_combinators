# Parser Combinators in C++

Source code accompanying the presentation which you can [find here](https://slides.com/qqwy/parser-combinators-in-c/).
This presentation was originally given at 2021-03-30 during the final lecture of the [University of Groningen's C++ course](http://www.icce.rug.nl/edu/).

Run `make` in either of the two folders (`simple` or `optimized`).

Each of the two implementations currently contain all code in a single file. This is not very clean, but hopefully makes tinkering easier.

Code is heavily documented. Enjoy :-).
